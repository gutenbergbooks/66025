<p>The “Sacrum Commercium”
is an Allegory,
simple in form and charming
in conception, telling how St
Francis wooed and won that
most difficult of all Brides, my
Lady Poverty. It was written
some time in the thirteenth
century (most probably in the
year 1227) by an unknown
Franciscan, and has been
six times printed, thrice in
Latin, and thrice in Italian.</p>

<p><span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Latin Editions.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The first Latin edition was
printed at Milan in 1539. It
is of exceeding rarity, and has
escaped the vigilance of Brunet
and Græsse. Père François
Van Ortroy, the noted
Bollandist (whom few things
escape), was the first to call
attention to a copy in the
Ambrosian Library, and it is
the only copy known to exist.
(See “Analecta Bollandiana,”
xix. 460.)</p>

<p>The second Latin edition
was published nearly 400
years later, in 1894, under the
editorship of Professor Edoardo
Alvisi, in the “Collezione di
Opuscoli Danteschi inediti o
rari diretta da G. L. Passerini.”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
Professor Alvisi’s edition has
no pretensions to being critical:
his sole object in publishing it
was to supply an illustration
to part of Canto XI. of the
“Paradiso.” This edition has,
perhaps justly, been decried
for its entire want of critical
apparatus, but it at least served
to call attention to a gem that
had hitherto slumbered uncared-for
in parchment Codexes.</p>

<p>The third Latin edition is
exceptional from every point
of view. It was published
only last year by Père
Edouard d’Alençon, the learned
Archivist General of the Friars
Minor Capuchins. Père
Edouard has taken his version
from a Codex (No. 3560) in
the Casanatese Library in
Rome, which he has carefully
collated with three other
Codexes (of Milan, Vincenza
and Ravenna), noting all the
variants at foot. There is but
one fault to find with this
scholarly edition: it does not
attempt to give the numerous
Scripture references.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p><span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Italian Editions.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The first Italian edition<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> appeared
in 1847 under the title
“Meditazione sulla Povertà
di Santo Francesco.”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> It is
taken from a Fourteenth-Century
Codex in the Franciscan
Convent of Giaccherino, near
Pistoia. Its editors were the
Lexicographer, Pietro Fanfani,
and a Canon of Pistoia, Enrico
Bindi. It has been quoted in
the great “Vocabolario” of the
Academicians of the Crusca,
and has therefore become a
“Testo di Lingua” or Italian
classic.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The “Meditazione”
is a very free translation indeed
from the original Latin. The
translator adds beauties and
leaves out obscurities at will.
It is curious to us in these
days, when Franciscan studies
are being pursued with such
avidity all the world over (if I
except England), to reflect
that the editors, Fanfani and
Bindi, did not know whether
the “Meditazione” was a
translation or an original
work. The Fourteenth-Century
translator is unknown.</p>

<p>The next Italian edition
(1900) is the one given in
parallel columns with the
Latin version of Père Edouard
d’Alençon’s work above
quoted. It is taken from
Codex B. 131 in the Vallicellian
Library, and is probably
a Fourteenth-Century work,
but, if interesting, it has little
or no merit as an example of
fine Tuscan.</p>

<p>The third Italian edition is a
much-needed and very welcome
work.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> It is a reprint of
the “Meditazione,” which has
for long been so scarce as to
be almost unprocurable. The
editor, Don Salvatore Minocchi,
a Florentine priest, and one of
the foremost authorities on
matters Franciscan, than whom
there could be no one more
fitted for the task, has carefully
collated the original edition of
the “Meditazione” with the
Codex from which it was taken,
and has removed quite a host
of erroneous readings. We
may therefore now be said to
have, for the first time, a correct
version of this little Italian
classic. It was only printed in
the last days of May, and I
have to thank the learned
editor for courteously permitting
me to see his proof sheets.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="AUTHORSHIP_AND_DATE">AUTHORSHIP AND DATE</h3>
</div>


<p>The authorship of the
“Sacrum Commercium”
has been freely ascribed to the
Blessed Giovanni da Parma,
seventh Minister General of
the Friars Minor in succession
to Saint Francis. I would
with all my heart that he were
the author, for Giovanni is one
of the brightest lights of the
Order, and both by his love
and practice of Poverty, and
by his great endowments, is
the ideal author for so exquisite
an allegory. The
“Chronica xxiv. Generalium,”
which was completed in 1379,
and begun perhaps twenty
years earlier, distinctly states
that Giovanni is the author
(“quendam libellum devotum
composuit quem intitulavit
Commercium Paupertatis”),<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
and this opinion was followed
by all succeeding old writers
(except Fra Bartolommeo da
Pisa, who makes no attempt
to assign authorship), and most
moderns, including Professor
Alvisi, M. Sabatier,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Professor
Umberto Cosmo,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and the
latest biographer of the Blessed,
Fra Luigi da Parma.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> But all
the Codexes which Père
Edouard d’Alençon cites, as
also a Codex in the Bodleian
and another in the Communal
library at Siena, give the date
of composition as the month
of July after the death of
Saint Francis, that is to say
July, 1227. (<i>Actum est hoc
opus mense Julii post obitum
Beatissimi Francisci, anno
Millesimo ducentesimo vigesimo
septimo ab Incarnatione
Domini Salvatoris Nostri Jesu
Christi.</i>) If this date be correct,
then the Blessed Giovanni
could not have been its author,
for he was only born in 1208,
and did not enter the Order
until after 1230. There is the
point that Mediæval scribes
were given (like other mortals)
to making errors in dates, more
especially when they were in
Roman figures, and these
errors would have been propagated
from Codex to Codex.
We have the well-known
instance of the Mazarin
Codex No. 1743, where the
erroneous date of 1228 led
a distinguished French critic
to look upon the “Speculum
Perfectionis” as the oldest
biography of St Francis.
The date was probably 1318,
and it will be seen how easily
a slip might be made between
MCCXXVIII and
MCCCXVIII.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> But in favour
of the date of 1227 for the
“Sacrum Commercium” we
have not only the fact that
the date is written in words
and not in figures, but
that the “explicit” distinctly
states that it was finished in
the July after the death of
St Francis. Such extreme
precision does not leave much
room for error. Moreover,
there is practically no serious
internal evidence against
the date 1227. It is true
that the Casanatese Codex,
at the beginning of Chap. iv.
speaks of “<i>Sanctum</i> Franciscum,”
whereas St Francis was
not canonized until 1228. But
this, even if some refuse to
translate it simply “the holy
Francis,” and insist upon “<i>St</i>
Francis,” I think it is fair to
regard as the slip of a scribe,
more especially as the Vincenzian
Codex gives “beatum”
in the same place, and both
Italian versions have “beato.”
There is, therefore, no substantial
reason why we may
not regard the “Sacrum Commercium”
as written in 1227,
and it is interesting to note
that this little allegory is thus
the first book ever written
on St Francis, for Thomas of
Celano’s “Legenda Prima,”
was not completed until the
following year.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>There are, to my mind, two
conclusive arguments, both
adduced by Père Edouard,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
against attributing the authorship
to Giovanni da Parma.
Fra Ubertino da Casale in a
famous work<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> (“too famous,”
it might justly be called),
finished in 1305, is the first
writer who expressly mentions
the “Sacrum Commercium,”
and he ascribes it merely to
“a certain holy doctor,” giving
no name. Now Ubertino
well knew Giovanni (<i>ob.</i> 1289),
and it seems impossible that
he should not also have known
and celebrated the Blessed as
the author of the “Sacrum
Commercium” had he really
been so. Again Fra Salimbene
da Parma (<i>ob.</i> 1287 or 1290)
knew the Blessed Giovanni
intimately, and alludes to him
frequently in his Chronicle.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
He even refers to writings of
Giovanni’s, but there is never
a hint of the “Sacrum Commercium.”
The only theory
on which it is possible to ascribe
the authorship to Fra
Giovanni is so wild as scarcely
to be worthy of mention. We
should have to suppose, seeing
the unpopularity of the
extremes of Poverty in a certain
section of the Order, that
he was afraid to acknowledge
his work, and that he deliberately,
and with much circumstance,
falsified the date
to secure his anonymity. But
the Blessed Giovanni was not
made of such poor stuff! He
who endured hatred, persecution
and imprisonment, to some
extent by reason of his zeal for
the Lady Poverty, was not the
man to resort to so trivial a
ruse. His deeds were far more
unpopular (with some) than
ever this little allegory could
have made him.</p>

<p>Père Edouard d’Alençon,
with much ingenuity, seeks
to credit Giovanni Parenti, St
Francis’ immediate successor
as Minister General (1227-1233),
with the authorship.
He gives an instance tending
to show that there was a tradition
that a Minister General
had written the work, and
then he points to the similarity
between “Joannes Parenti”
and “Joannes Parmensis.”
All this proves his acumen
and ingenuity, but he is too
severely scientific a scholar to
advance a clever theory as
proof positive. For the present
it is safest to admit frankly
that the author of the “Sacrum
Commercium” is unknown, and
to conclude with Fra Ubertino
da Casale that he was “quidam
sanctus doctor hujus Sanctæ
Paupertatis professor et zelator
strenuus.”</p>

<p>I have translated from
Père Edouard d’Alençon’s
version of the Codex Casanatensis.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
But I have not
slavishly adhered to this,
using, when they seemed more
apt, the variants which he has
so diligently noted at foot.
I have also, now and again,
used the Italian version of the
Codex Vallicellianus, and,
though very rarely, even the
classic “Meditazione.” In my
translation I have been no
bondsman, but have rendered
freely, while seeking to convey
accurately the spirit and meaning
of the work, and to preserve,
as far as that might be,
the elemental simplicity of its
language.</p>

<p>The “Sacrum Commercium”
is a tissue of the words and
phrases of St Jerome’s beautiful
Latin version of Holy
Scripture. Where so much is
Biblical, I have had to a certain
extent to adopt Biblical
language, but I have striven
earnestly to avoid those excesses
of Archaism which irritate
even the most equable
nerves. With the help of
Cardinal Hugo’s “Concordantiæ
Sacrorum Bibliorum”
(may his name live for ever!)
I have endeavoured to give
references to the principal
quotations from Holy Writ.
Some will assuredly have escaped
me, and I shall be grateful
to him who points out to
me any omissions.</p>

<p>The reader must not forget
that it was the Latin Vulgate
which was used by the author
of the “Sacrum Commercium.”
To be faithful, therefore, I
could not take my quotations
straight from the “Authorised
Version.” I have translated
sometimes after my own
fashion, sometimes with the
help of the “Douay” version,
but when the sense has allowed
of it, I have gladly adopted
the noble English of King
James’ Bible.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And now, <i>lector humanissime</i>,
I am glad to have done with
all these dry details, necessary
perchance to a right understanding
of the subject, and to
leave thee free to hasten onward
to the green Pastures
and still Waters of one of the
fairest of Mediæval Idylls.
Feed in those fresh Pastures,
dip in the restoring Waters:
thou canst not but gather
therefrom health and strength,
life, and the Life to come;
together with a right knowledge
of the Past, a loving
pity for the Present, and a
valorous good resolution for
the Future.</p>

<p>Among the cardinal excelling
virtues which
prepare a place and mansion
for God in the Soul of Man,
and show a more excellent and
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1 Cor. xii. 31.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
a speedier way of approaching
and attaining unto Him, Holy
Poverty shines resplendent in
her authority, and excels all
others by her peculiar Grace.
For she is the Foundation and
Guardian of all the Virtues,
and holds the Primacy among
the Evangelical Counsels.
Wherefore let not the other
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Matt. vii. 25.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Virtues fear should the rain
descend, and the floods come,
and the winds blow, threatening
destruction, if only they
have been founded upon the
Rock of Poverty. And justly;
for the Son of God, the Lord
of Hosts and King of Glory,
loved this Virtue with a special
love, sought this Virtue, found
her, and by her wrought Salvation
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Ps. lxxiii. 12.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
in the midst of the Earth.
Her, in the beginning of His
preaching, He placed as a
Beacon to lighten those entering
the Haven of the Faith,
and as chief corner-stone of
His House. The Kingdom of
Heaven which He promised
hereafter to all the Virtues, He
openeth to Poverty even in
this life. For “Blessed,” He
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Matt. v. 3.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
has said, “are the Poor in
Spirit, for theirs <i>is</i> the Kingdom
of Heaven.”<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> They are
worthy of the Kingdom of
Heaven who have freely renounced
all Earthly Things
out of Love and Desire for
Heavenly Things. He must
needs live by Heavenly Things
who takes no thought of
Earthly Things, and counts
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Phil. iii. 8.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
them but as dung: even in
this our Exile shall he feed on
the honied crumbs which fall
from the table of the Holy
Angels, that he may taste and
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Ps. xxxiii. 8.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
see how sweet the Lord is.
This is truly to find the Kingdom
of Heaven; ’tis the Pledge
of an Eternal Mansion therein,
and, as it were, a foretaste of
the Blessedness to come.</p>

<p>HOW THE BLESSED FRANCIS
MADE DILIGENT SEARCH FOR
THE LADY POVERTY</p>
</div>


<p>Wherefore the
Blessed Francis, as a
true Follower and Disciple of
the Saviour, gave himself up
from the beginning of his
Conversion with all his Heart,
with all his Strength, and with
all his Mind, to seek and to
find, to have and to hold the
Lady Poverty, dreading no
Adversity, fearing no Evil,
sparing no labour, shunning no
suffering of the body, so only
that he might come unto her
to whom the Lord had given
the Keys of the Kingdom of
Heaven. Like an eager explorer
he began to go about
the highways and by-ways of
the City, diligently seeking
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Cant. iii. 2.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
her whom his Soul did love.
He asked of those who stood
about, he questioned those who
met him, saying: Saw ye her
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Cant. iii. 3.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
whom my Soul loveth? But
his speech was dark to them
as an alien tongue, and, not
understanding him, they
answered: We know not what
thou sayest: speak to us in
our own tongue, and we will
answer thee. For there was
not at that time any word or
sign in the language, by which
the Children of Adam could
discourse together of Poverty.
They hated her then as they
hate her now, nor could they
speak with patience to one
who sought her. So they
answered him that this thing
was unknown to them, and
that they had no knowledge
of what he sought. Then,
said the Blessed Francis, I will
go unto the Great and the
Wise, and ask them, for they
know the Ways of the Lord
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Jer. v. 5.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
and the Judgments of God.
But these only answered him
yet more roughly, saying:
What is this new doctrine
which thou bringest to our
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Acts xvii. 20.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
ears? May that Poverty which
thou seekest always abide with
thee, and with thy children,
and with thy seed after thee.
As for us, we had rather enjoy
the delights of life and abound
in riches, for the span of our
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Wisdom ii. 1.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Life is short and tedious, and
in the end of a man there is no
remedy. Therefore we know
nothing better than to eat and
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Luke xii. 19.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
drink and be merry while there
is still time.</p>

<p>But the Blessed Francis,
hearing these things, marvelled
in his Heart and gave Thanks
to God, saying: Blessed art
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Matt. xi. 25.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Thou, O Lord God, Who
hast hid these things from the
Wise and Prudent, and revealed
them unto Babes. Even
so, Father, for so it hath
seemed good in Thy Sight.
O God, the Author and Ruler
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Eccli. xxiii. 1.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
of my being, deliver me not
over to their Counsels, nor
suffer me to fall into their
iniquity, but give me Thy
Grace, so that I may find what
I seek, for I am Thy servant,
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Ps. cxv. 16.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
and the Son of Thy Handmaid.</p>

<p>HOW TWO OLD MEN SHOWED
THE BLESSED FRANCIS WHERE
THE MIGHT FIND THE LADY
POVERTY</p>
</div>


<p>And the Blessed Francis,
being come out of the
City, made haste to reach a
certain field, in which, from
afar off, he saw two old men
sitting, full of a heavy sorrow,
the one of whom was saying:
To whom shall I look save to
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Isa. lxvi. 2.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
some Poor Little Man, contrite
of Heart, and who fears
my Words? And the other:
For we brought nothing into
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1 Tim. vi. 7, 8.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
this World, and it is certain
we can carry nothing out of it.
But having food and a covering
to our Bodies, let us be
therewith content.</p>

<p>And when the Blessed Francis
had come up with them,
he said unto them: Tell me, I
beseech you, where the Lady
Poverty dwells, where she
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Cant. i. 6.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
feeds her flock, where she
takes her rest at noon, for I
languish for the Love of her.
But they answered him, saying:
O good Brother, we have
sat here for a Time, and Times,
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Dan. xii. 7.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
and half a Time, and have
often seen her pass this way,
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Apoc. xii. 14.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
and many were they who
sought her. Many were they,
once upon a time, who walked
in her train, but oft she would
return alone and desolate, unadorned
by jewels or fine raiment,
unescorted by any
following. And she would
weep bitterly, saying: The
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Cant. i. 5.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Sons of my Mother have
fought against me. But we
did answer and say: Have
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Cant. i. 3.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
patience, for the Righteous
love thee. And now, O
Brother, ascend the great and
high Mountain whereon the
Lord hath placed her. For
she dwelleth in the Holy
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Ps. lxxxvi. 1, 2.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Mountains, because God hath
loved her more than all the
tents of Jacob. Giants have
failed to follow her footsteps,
and the Eagle to fly to the
summit of her Hill. Poverty
is the one thing despised of all
men, for it is not found in the
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Job xxviii. 13.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
land of them that live in delights.
Wherefore she is hid
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Job xxviii. 21, 23.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
from the eyes of the Living,
and the fowls of the air know
her not. But God understandeth
her way; He knoweth
her Dwelling-place. If
therefore, O Brother, thou
wouldst ascend unto her, put
off the Garments of thy Pleasures,
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Heb. xii. 1.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
and lay aside every
weight and the Sin which besets
thee, for unless thou art
free from these trammels, thou
canst not attain unto her who
is placed at so great a height.
But because My Lady is
gracious, she is easily seen by
those who love her, and found
by those who seek her. To
meditate upon her, Brother, is
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Wisdom vi. 16.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
perfect Understanding, and
whoso watcheth for her shall
speedily be secure. Take with
thee trusty Companions that
thou may’st profit by their
Counsel, and be sustained by
their Help in the way, for woe
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Eccl. iv. 10.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
to him that is alone; when he
falleth he shall have none to
raise him up. But do you
uphold one another.</p>

<p>OF THE FIRST COMPANIONS OF
THE BLESSED FRANCIS</p>
</div>

<p>And when he had heard
these Counsels, the
Blessed Francis chose unto
himself a few faithful Companions,
with whom he set out
for the Mountain. And he
said unto his brothers: Come
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Isa. ii. 3.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
ye, let us go up to the Mountain
of the Lord, to the House
of the Lady Poverty, that she
may teach us her Ways, and
we will walk in her Paths.
And when they beheld the
Ascent from every side, and
saw how exceeding high and
steep it was, they began to say
one to another: Who shall
ascend this Mountain, and who
shall reach unto the Mountain’s
top? The which, when Blessed
Francis heard, he said unto
them: Strait is the Way, and
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Matt. vii. 14.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
narrow the Gate, which leadeth
unto Life, and few there be
that find it. Be strong in the

Lord, and in the power of
His Might, and all things
difficult will become easy unto
us. Lay down the Burden of
your own Will, cast away the
heavy Weight of your Sins,
and gird yourselves like Strong
Men. Forget those things
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Phil. iii. 13.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
which are behind, and reach
forth to those which are before.
I say unto you that every

place that your foot shall tread
upon shall be yours. For as a
Spirit before our face is Christ
the Lord, drawing us to the
Mountain’s summit by the
Bonds of Charity. Wonderful,

<p>HOW THE BLESSED FRANCIS
AND HIS COMPANIONS FOUND
THE LADY POVERTY ON THE
MOUNTAIN</p>
</div>


<p>And when he had thus
spoken, they followed
after the Blessed Francis.
And as with light feet they
hastened to the summit of the
Mountain, they beheld my
Lady Poverty on the topmost
Pinnacle gazing down the
Mountain. And when she
saw them climbing thus
valiantly, nay, as it were,
rather flying towards her, she
marvelled exceedingly, and said
to herself: Who are these that
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Isa. lx. 8.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
fly like the Clouds and as
Doves to their windows? It
is long since I saw such as
these, or looked upon men so
free from trammels. Therefore
will I speak to them of the
things which I ponder in my
Heart, lest, like the rest, they
should repent them of their
hardy ascent when they behold
the dizzying abyss below. I
know they cannot possess me
without my consent, but I
shall find Favour before
my Heavenly Father if I
give them the Counsels of
Salvation. And behold a
Voice spoke unto her, saying:
Fear not, Daughter of Sion,
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>John xii. 15.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
for these are of the Seed which
the Lord hath blessed. He
hath elected them in Charity
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>2 Cor. vi. 6.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
unfeigned. So from the Throne
of her Neediness, the Lady
Poverty presented them with
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Ps. xx. 4.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Blessings of Sweetness, and
said unto them: Tell me the
cause of your Advent, my
Brothers, and why you hasten
thus speedily from the Valley
of Tears to the Mountain of
Light. Can it indeed be that
you seek me who am poor and
needy, tossed by the tempest,

<p>And the Blessed Francis
and his Companions
answered her, saying: Yea,
we have indeed come out to
seek thee, Lady, and we beseech
thee to receive us in
Peace. We desire to become
the Servants of the Lord of

proved it by experience.
Wherefore, prostrate at thy
Feet, we humbly beseech thee
to abide with us, and to light
our Way to the King of Glory,
as thou wast unto Him the
Way, when, a Day-Spring

thee, Who through thee did
redeem us. Do but elect to
save us, and we shall be made
free. For the King of Kings

the Creator of Heaven and
Earth, desired thy Comeliness

His Royal Seat, and sought
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Ps. cxi. 3.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
thee with gracious words.
Great therefore is thy Dignity,
and there is none so exalted as
thee, since He could leave all
Angelic Delights and the great
Abundance of Celestial Virtues,

<p>But then came the Lord,
the Lord God, and took thee
for Himself, and lifted up thy
Head among the Tribes of the
people, crowning thee His
Bride, and exalting thee above
the Highest Heavens. And
although, of a surety, many
still hate thee, not knowing
thy Virtue and thy Glory, yet
hast thou nothing lost thereby,
for thou dwellest in Freedom
in thy holy Mountains, in the
most firm habitation of the
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Exod. xv. 17.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Glory of Christ. Thus the
Son of the Most High, having
become a Lover of thy Beauty,
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Wisdom viii. 2.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
dwelt only with thee in the
World, and found thee most
faithful in all Things. Even
before He left His bright
Realms for the Earth, thou
hadst prepared Him a fitting
place, a Throne on which to
sit, a Couch in which to rest,
a most poor Virgin from whom
He sprung, and shone upon
the World. At His Nativity
thou didst run to meet Him,
so that He might find comfort
in thee, and not in soft places.
Thou didst lay Him in a
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Luke ii. 7.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Manger, as saith the Evangelist,
for there was no room in
the Inn. And thus didst thou
always inseparably accompany
Him, so that during His whole
Life, while He dwelt among
Men, though the Foxes had
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Matt. viii. 20.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Caves, and the Birds of the
Air Nests, He had no place to
lay His Head. And when
He Who in the Past had
opened the lips of the Prophets
opened His own Lips to preach,
among the many things which
He spake, He first praised,
first exalted thee, saying:
Blessed are the Poor in Spirit,
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Matt. v. 3.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
for theirs is the Kingdom of
Heaven. And when He chose
Witnesses to His Holy Preaching
and to His glorious Work
for the Salvation of Man, He
did not take rich Merchants,
but poor Fisherfolk, that by
this choice He might show
forth that thou wert to be
loved by All. And finally
that thy Goodness, thy Greatness,
thy Power, might be
made manifest to All, and how
thou art above all the Virtues,
and how without thee there is
no Virtue, and how thy Kingdom
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>John xviii. 36.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
is not of this World but
from Heaven, thou alone didst
remain with the King of Glory
when all His Elect and Beloved
had fled from Him in
Affright.</p>

<p>Like unto a most dear
Mistress and faithful Spouse,
thou didst not leave Him for
an instant. The more He was
despised by All, the more
didst thou cleave to Him.
For if thou hadst not been
with Him, He could never
have been so despised by All.
Thou wast with Him when
the Jews reviled, the Pharisees
scoffed, and the High Priests
reproached Him. Thou wast
with Him when He was
struck, when He was spat
upon, when He was scourged.
He Who should have been
reverenced by All, was derided
by all, and thou alone didst
minister unto Him. Thou
wast with Him unto Death,
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Phil. ii. 8.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
even the Death of the Cross.
And on the Cross itself, His
Body being stripped, His
Arms extended, His Hands
and Feet pierced, thou didst
suffer with Him, so that
nothing did seem more
glorious in Him than thou.</p>

<p>When He ascended into
Heaven, He left to thee the
Seal of the Kingdom of Heaven,
that thou might’st seal the
Elect, that whosoever should
aspire to Eternal Life might
come to thee, pray to thee,
and enter by thee, for if he be
not sealed with thy Seal, no
man may enter the Kingdom
of Heaven. Therefore, O
Lady, have compassion upon
us, and seal us with the Seal
of thy Grace. For who is
there so craven-spirited and
foolish as not to love thee
with all his Heart, thee who
hast been chosen by the Most
High, and prepared from all
Eternity? Who is there that
does not reverence and honour
thee, when He Whom all the
Heavenly Host adore hath
clothed thee with such Honour?
Who would not readily
adore thy Footsteps, to whom
the Lord of Majesty so humbly
inclined, whom He so intimately
embraced, to whom he
was joined in so great a Love?
We therefore beseech thee, O
Lady, by Him and through
Him, despise not our petitions

<p>THE ANSWER OF MY LADY
POVERTY</p></div>


<p>To these Words my Lady
Poverty, with joyful
Heart, and cheerful Mien, and
most sweet Voice, made
answer, saying: I confess to
you, my Brothers and most
dear Friends, that from the
moment you began to speak,
I was filled with Gladness and
exceeding great Joy, for I
acknowledge your Fervour,
and already know your Holy
Intent; your words are dearer
to me than Gold and Precious
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Ps. xviii. 11.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Stones, and sweeter far than
Honey and the Honeycomb.
For it is not you that speak,
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Mark xiii. 11.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
but the Holy Ghost that
speaketh in you, and it is His
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1 John ii. 27.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Unction that inspires you in
all the things which you have
spoken concerning the Most
High King, Who by His
Grace alone chose me as His
Beloved, taking away my Reproach
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Luke i. 25.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
among Men, and
glorifying me among the
Highest in Heaven. Therefore
I desire, if it will not
weary you, to tell you the
story of my Estate. It is a
long Story, but not less useful,
and will teach you how to
walk with God and please
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Gen. v. 22.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Him, giving heed that you
who wish to put your hands
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Luke ix. 62.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
to the plough in no wise look
back.</p>

<p>I am not new,<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> as many
think, but old and full of
years, knowing the nature of
Things, the Varieties of Creatures,
the mutability of Time.
I know the vacillations of the
Heart of Man, in part by the
experience of Ages, in part by
subtlety of Nature, in part by
the Merit of Grace. In the
beginning I dwelt in the
Paradise of God, where Man
was naked. Or rather, I was
in Man, and of his Essence
when he was naked, walking
with him in that spacious
Paradise, fearing nothing,
doubting nothing, thinking
no Evil. I thought to have
stayed with him forever, for
he had been created by the
Most High, just, good, and
wise, and placed in a most
beautiful and delectable Place.
I was joyful exceeding, entertaining
him at all Times, for
possessing Nothing, he belonged
wholly to God. But,
woe is me, he succumbed to
Evil, which had been unknown
from the beginning of the
Creation, and the unhappy
Spirit of Evil, who, through
Vainglory, had lost Wisdom,
entered the body of a Serpent
because he could not inhabit
Heaven, and treacherously assailed
Man, that like himself
he might become a transgressor
of the Divine Law. Unhappy
Man, giving ear unto his evil
Counsellor, acquiesced and
consented, and having forgotten
God, his Creator,
followed the Example of the
first Transgressor. In the
beginning, says Holy Writ,
Man was naked but not
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Gen. ii. 25.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
ashamed, for he was perfect
in innocence. But having
sinned, he knew that he
was naked, and being
ashamed, he hastily made
himself an apron of the leaves
of the fig-tree.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>When, therefore, I saw that
my Companion had sinned,
and was dressed in leaves (for
he had nothing else), I left
him. And standing afar off,
I beheld him through my
Tears, and waited for Him
Who should save me from
Faintness of Spirit in so great
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Ps. liv. 9.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
a Storm. And suddenly there
came a Sound from Heaven
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Acts ii. 2.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
that shook the whole of Paradise,
and a most bright Light
shone from Heaven. And I
looked and beheld the Lord of
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Gen. iii. 8.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Majesty walking in Paradise in
the cool of the day, resplendent
in ineffable Glory. A mighty
Host of Angels was in His
Train, crying with a loud
Voice: Holy, Holy, Holy,
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Isa. vi. 3.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Lord God of Sabaoth, the
Earth is full of the Majesty
of Thy Glory. Thousands of
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Dan. vii. 10.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Thousands ministered unto
Him, and ten thousand times
a hundred thousand<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> stood
before Him. Then in Fear
and Trembling, overcome with
Dread and Amazement, my
Body chill, my Heart fast beating,
I cried out of the Depths:
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Ps. cxxix. 1.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Mercy, Lord&mdash;have Mercy!
Enter not into Judgment with
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Ps. cxlii. 2.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Thy Servant, for in Thy Sight
shall no Man living be justified.
But He said unto me: Go,
hide thyself for a while, until
Mine Anger be overpast. And
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Isa. xxvi. 20.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
straightway He called my
Companion, saying: Adam,
where art thou? Who
answered: I heard Thy Voice,
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Gen. iii. 9, 10.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
and was afraid, because I was
naked, and I hid myself.
Naked indeed!  The man who
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Luke x. 30.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
went down from Jerusalem to
Jericho and fell among Thieves
was stripped of this World’s
Goods, but Adam had been
robbed of the Likeness of God.
But that King Who is Most
High and yet most Gracious,
awaited his Repentance, and
gave him the Opportunity of
returning to Him. Yet in his
wretchedness he inclined his
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Ps. cxl. 4.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Heart to evil Words, and to
making excuses for Sin. And
thus he increased his guilt, and
heaped up punishment, treasuring
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Rom. ii. 5.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
up unto himself Wrath
against the day of Wrath and
Revelation of the just Judgment
of God. For he spared
not himself nor his seed after
him, delivering up All to the
terrible Curse of Death.</p>

<p>And all the Angels that
were present condemned him,
and the Lord cast him forth
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Gen. iii. 23.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
from Paradise by a just but
not less merciful Judgment,
and bade him return to the
Earth from whence he was
taken, greatly tempering the
Curse He had laid upon him.
And being stripped of his robe
of Innocence, God made him
garments of skins, therein signifying
that Death had come
into the World. And when I
saw my Companion clothed
with the skins of dead beasts,
I left him altogether, for he
had been cast forth to multiply
his labours, whereby he might
become rich. I went forth a
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Gen. iv. 12.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
fugitive and wanderer upon the
Earth, weeping and mourning
exceedingly, and I found not
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Gen. viii. 9.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
where to rest the sole of my
Foot. When Abraham, Isaac,
Jacob, and the other Patriarchs,
received in promise Riches and
a Land flowing with Milk and
Honey, I sought Rest among
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Eccli. xxiv. 11.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
them, but found none. A
Cherub with a Flaming Sword
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Gen. iii. 24.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
stood before the Gates of Paradise
until the Most High came
down from the Bosom of the
Father, Who sought me out
most graciously. And when
He had fulfilled all those
Things of which you have
spoken, and desired to return
to the Father Who had sent
Him, He made me a Testament
to His Elect, and confirmed
it by irrefragable Decrees:
Lay not up Gold nor
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Matt. x. 9.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Silver, nor Money. Carry
neither Purse, nor Scrip, nor
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Matt. x. 10 and Luke x. 4.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Bread, nor a Staff, nor Shoes,
nor two Coats. And if any
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Matt. v. 40.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Man will contend with thee
and take away thy Coat, let
go thy Cloak also. And whoever
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Matt. v. 41.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
shall compel thee to go a
Mile, go with him other twain.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Matt. vi. 19.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Lay not up unto yourselves
Treasures upon Earth, where
Rust and Moth doth corrupt,
and where Thieves break
through and steal. Take no
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Matt. vi. 31.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
thought, saying: What shall
we eat, or what shall we drink,
or wherewithal shall we be
clothed? And take no
Thought of the Morrow, for
the Morrow will take Thought
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Matt. vi. 34.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
for itself. Sufficient unto the
Day is the Evil thereof.
Whosoever doth not renounce
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Luke xiv. 33.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
all that he hath, cannot be my
disciple.... And many the
like sayings, which are all to
be found in the Gospels.</p>

<p>All which Things the
Apostles and all the
Disciples most diligently observed,
nor did they ever fail
to fulfil the Things they had
heard from the Master. They
bore themselves as most valiant
Knights and Judges of the
Earth, carrying the Message
of Salvation everywhere, the
Lord working with them, and
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Mark xvi. 20.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
confirming the Word with
Signs that followed. They
glowed in Charity, abounded
in Piety, and endured every
Want, taking care that it
should not be said of them:
These men preach but do not
practise. Hence one of them
speaketh boldly, saying: For
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Rom. xv. 18, 19.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
I will not dare to speak of any
of those Things which Christ
hath not wrought by me by
Word and Deed, and by the
Power of the Holy Ghost.
And yet another speaketh
thus: Silver and Gold have I
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Acts iii. 6.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
none. Thus did they, one and
all, in Life and in Death,
exalt me by the highest Praises.
And those who heard these
Masters, gave heed to their
Preaching, selling all their
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Acts ii. 45.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
goods and substance, and
dividing them according as
every man had need. And
they were all together and had

all things in common, praising
God and having favour with

For if any of them sought to

Compassion, and bitterly repent
of the Temptation, clinging

embracing me more eagerly

<p>THAT TIMES OF PEACE ARE

<p>But the Crown of all the
Virtues, and that is the
Lady Persecution, to whom
the Lord, equally with me,
delivered the Kingdom of
Heaven, was by my side, and
in all things a faithful Helper,
a strong Champion, and a prudent
Counsellor. She, when
she saw any grow lukewarm in
Heavenly Charity, or forgetting
it a while, or fixing their
Hearts on Earthly Things,
she straightway sounded the
Trump and moved her Armies,
and made their faces to be
ashamed, that they might seek

now my Sister has left me,
the Light of my Eyes is not

are at rest from the Persecutors,
they are most cruelly
torn by civil and intestine
War, envying each other, and
struggling for the acquisition
of Wealth and an abundance
of luxuries.</p>

<p>After a while some began
to breathe again, and wished
of their own accord to walk in
the right Road, which once
they had walked in of necessity.
All these came to me
with prayers and tears, and

as I formerly did in the days
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Job xxix. 4.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
of my Youth, when the Lord
was with me, and my Children
were round about me. These
were men of virtue, peaceful
men, without Rebuke before
the Lord, constant in brotherly
Love, so long as they remained
in the Flesh, poor in
Spirit, poor in this World’s
Goods, rich in Holiness,
abounding in the Gifts of
Heavenly Grace, fervent in
Spirit, rejoicing in Hope,
patient in Tribulation, meek
and humble of Heart, and
keeping Peace in their Souls,
Harmony in their Ways,
Steadfastness in their Hearts,
and a joyful Unity in their
Walk through Life. These
men were indeed devoted to
God, pleasing to the Angels,
beloved of Men, unsparing to
themselves, merciful to Others,
devout in Deed, modest in
Demeanour, cheerful of Countenance,
earnest of Heart,
humble in Prosperity, high-minded
in Adversity, temperate
of Life, sober in Dress, sparing
of Sleep, modest and devout,
shining before all Men in the
Light of their Good Works.
My Soul was joined unto
these my Sons, and there was

<p>OF AVARICE</p>
</div>


<p>Avarice was this Rival’s
name, and she is the
Immoderate Desire of acquiring
and holding Riches. But
they called her by a holier
Name, so that it might not
seem that they had abandoned
me, by whose Gift they had
been raised from the Dust and
lifted up out of the Mire. So
they spake gently of her to
me, but there was Craft and
Anger in their Hearts. And
though the Desolation of a
City which is set upon a Hill
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Matt. v. 14.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
cannot be hid, yet they gave
her the Name of Discretion or
Foresight, though such Discretion
were better named Confusion,
and such Foresight a
pernicious Forgetfulness of all
Good Works. And they said
unto me: Thine is the Power;
thine the Kingdom: fear not.
It is good to use Charity and
labour for Good Ends, to
succour the Needy and give
to the Poor. But I answered:
What you say is just, Brothers,
but I beseech you, consider
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1 Cor. i. 26.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
your Calling. Do not look
back. Do not come down
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Matt. xxiv. 17.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
from the house-top to take
anything out of your Houses,
neither return back from the
fields to take your Clothes.
Do not be busied about this
World’s Affairs, nor be entangled
again in its Pollution,
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>2 Pet. ii. 20, 21.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
which you have escaped through
the Knowledge of the Saviour.
For those who are entangled
therein a second time must
needs be overcome, and the
latter End is worse with them
than the Beginning, if by a
Pretence of Piety they turn
from the Holy Commandment
which has been delivered unto
them. And after I had thus
spoken, there arose a Dissension
among them, for some
said that I was good and spoke
the Truth, but others that I
desired to seduce them into
following me, in that I was
wretched, and wished to make
them wretched with me.</p>

<p>HOW THE LADY POVERTY
SPOKE OF GOOD RELIGIOUS</p>
</div>


<p>My Rival could not yet
drive me out of their
Land, for there were still many
Men among them in all the
great Zeal and Charity of their
First Fervour, who assailed
Heaven by their Cries, and
penetrated to the Throne of
God by their Perseverance in
Prayer, rapt in Contemplation
and despising all Things which
were of the Earth. Then the
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Eccli. xxiv. 12.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Creator of All Things commanded
me, and He Who
created me said: Let thy
Dwelling be in Jacob, and
thine inheritance in Israel, and
take thou Root in My Elect.
All which Things I most diligently
obeyed. And while I
abode with them, and we
walked together on the Royal
Road, they became, on my
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Wisdom viii. 10, 11.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
account, of good Repute
among the People, and admirable
in the Sight of the
Mighty. They were honoured
by all Men, and reputed as
Saints, though they could
not endure to be thus called,
remembering what the Son of
God had said: I seek no
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>John viii. 50.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Glory from Man; therefore
they refused all Honour offered
them by Men.</p>

<p>HOW AVARICE TOOK THE NAME
OF DISCRETION</p>
</div>


<p>But whilst my Disciples
were thus walking in so
great Fervour of the Love of
Christ, Avarice, taking to
herself the Name of Discretion,
spake and said unto
them: Do not show yourselves
so severe to Mankind, nor
thus contemn their Honours,
but have a kindly Countenance
for them, and do not outwardly
reject the Honours offered to
you: be content to do so
inwardly. It is a good thing
to have the Friendship of
Kings, the Acquaintance of
Princes, the Intimacy of the
Great, for if they honour and
venerate you, if they rise up to
meet you, many seeing this
shall follow their Example,
and be the more easily turned
to God. And my Friends,
acknowledging these advantages,
but not guarding themselves
from the Snare which
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Ps. cxlii. 4.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
had been set in the Way, in
the End embraced Honours
and Glory with all their Heart.
They thought themselves to
be inwardly such as they
seemed outwardly, but they
gloried in the Praises they
received, and were like the
Foolish Virgins without Oil,
profitless servants upon the
Earth. And Men who believed
them to be interiorly
that which they seemed exteriorly,
freely offered them
their Goods in Remission of
their Sins. In the beginning
they had counted all these
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Phil. iii. 8.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Things as dung, saying: We
are Poor Men and always desire
to be Poor; we do not
desire your goods but you.
We have Food and wherewithal
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1 Tim. vi. 8.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
to cover ourselves and
desire no more, for Vanity of
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Eccl. i. 2.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Vanities and All is Vanity.
Wherefore the devotion of
Men towards them increased
still more, so that many held
in small Regard the Goods
which they saw thus despised
of the Saints.</p>

<p>HOW AVARICE TOOK THE
NAME OF PRUDENCE</p>
</div>


<p>That cruel Enemy of
mine, Avarice, seeing
this, began to grow exceeding
angry, and to gnash her teeth,
and in vexation of Spirit said
to herself: What shall I do?
For all the World is going
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>John xii. 19.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
after her! I will take, said
she, the Name of Prudence,
and will speak in their Hearts,
and perchance they shall hear
and consent. And she did as
she had said, speaking unto
them humble words, and saying:
What do you here all
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Matt, xx. 6.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
the Day idle and making no
Provision for the Morrow?
In what could it hurt you to
have the necessaries of Life,
so long as you lack all Superfluities?
For in Peace and
Quietness could you work out
your Salvation and the Salvation
of Mankind, if you were
supplied with all Things Needful
to you. Therefore, while
you have Time, provide for
yourselves and those who shall
come after you, for Men may
not always be so generous to
you, nor give you the customary
Gifts. It would be good
for you to be always as you
are, but that is impossible, for
God causes you daily to increase
and multiply. Would
God reject you because you
had Wherewith to give to the
Needy, and could remember
the Poor, when He Himself
has said: It is more blessed to
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Acts xx. 35.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
give than to receive? Why,
therefore, do you not receive
the Goods which are offered
you, and not defraud the
Givers of their Eternal Reward?
You need fear no harm from
the possession of Riches, so
long as you account them as
Nought. There is no Evil in
Things themselves, but only
in the Soul of Man, for God
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Gen. i. 31.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
saw All Things and they were
good. To the Good, all
Things are good, all Things
serviceable, for them All
Things were made. O how
many having possessions use
them evilly, which had they
been yours, would have been
put to a good use, for holy is
your Purpose, holy your Desire.
You do not wish to
enrich your Relations who are
already rich enough, but simply
to have All Things necessary,
so that your Conversation may
be the more honest and
orderly. These, and similar
things, she said unto them,
and some having already a
corrupt Conscience, gave a
ready Assent. But others
turned a deaf ear to her Sayings,
and by shrewd Answers
refuted her Reasoning, alleging,
as did also their opponents,
Arguments from Holy Writ.</p>

<p>HOW AVARICE CALLED IN THE

<p>But Avarice, seeing that
she could not, unaided,
attain her ends upon my Disciples,
changed her plan, that
she might better fulfil her
Purpose. So she called in
Sloth, who neglects to begin
good Works, or to finish those
begun. And Avarice made a
Treaty with Sloth, and entered
into a Compact with her
against the Religious. They
were not intimate, these two,
nor closely affined, but they
readily made Common Cause
in Evil-doing, as formerly did
Pilate with Herod against the
Messiah. And when their
Plan was laid, Sloth began
her Ravages, and having given
Assault with her Satellites, she
entered the Domain of the
Religious, and by sheer Force
carried off their Arms and
extinguished their Charity,
reducing them to Tepidity and
Sluggishness. And so, a little
also by Pusillanimity of Spirit,
they became altogether dead
of Heart.</p>

<p>OF THE RELIGIOUS WHO WERE
CONQUERED BY SLOTH<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>
</div>


<p>After a While some of
the Religious began to
sigh most lamentably for the
Flesh-pots of Egypt which
they had left behind, and
ignobly to seek what with
noble Heart they had abandoned.
They fretted at having
to walk in the Ways of
God’s Commandments, and
followed His Injunctions with
a barren Heart. They grew
faint under their Burden, and
for Want of the Spirit could
scarcely breathe. Compunction
they rarely felt, and never
Contrition; at Obedience they
murmured; their Thoughts
were Earthy, their Joy carnal,
paltry their Sorrow and their
Speech imprudent, their
Laughter easily provoked.
Mirthful of Visage, their
Carriage full of Vanity, their
Garments soft and delicate,
carefully cut, and still more
carefully fashioned, they slept
inordinately, ate overmuch, and
drank intemperately. Their
talk was full of Jests, and
Railleries, and Idle Words.
They engaged in Story-telling,
changed the Rule, disposed
of Patronage, and were busily
occupied about the Affairs of
the World. Of Spiritual Exercises
there was no Care or
Thought; but rarely Exhortations
to save the Soul; they
had become lukewarm in
Celestial Things. In the
Hardness of their Hearts they
began to envy one another, to
provoke one another, to domineer
over one another, one
Brother eagerly bringing the
vilest Accusations against
another. They shunned Gravity,
and sought false Sources
of Joy, seeing that they could
not have the true. Nevertheless
they kept up some show
of Sanctity, so that they might
not be utterly despised, and
by holy Talk they sought to
hide their wretched way of
Life from the Simple. But
so great was the Ruin of the
Interior Man, that, unable to
contain themselves, their evil
Life burst forth in exterior
Manifestations. In short they
began to fawn upon the
World, striking bargains with
Worldlings that they might
empty their Purses, and they
enlarged their Buildings and
multiplied those Things which
they had forever renounced.
They bartered their Words to
the Rich, and their Courtesies
to Noble Ladies. They eagerly
frequented the Courts of
Kings and Princes, that they
might join House to House
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Isa. v. 8.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
and lay field to field. And
now they have become great
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Jer. v. 27.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
and rich, and have waxed
strong, because they have
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Jer. ix. 3.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
proceeded from Evil to Evil
and have not known God.
They were cast down when
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Ps. lxxii. 18.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
they were lifted up; they fell
to the Earth before their
Birth, and yet they say unto

<p>HOW THE LADY POVERTY
SORROWED OVER CERTAIN
RELIGIOUS WHO WERE POOR
IN THE WORLD, AND YET
MORE PRONE THAN OTHERS
TO SELF-INDULGENCE IN
RELIGION</p>
</div>


<p>In my Sorrow I sorrowed
all the more over certain
Religious who had been poor
and contemptible in the World,
and yet grew rich after they
had come to me. And when
they had waxed fat and gross
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Deut. xxxii. 15.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
beyond the rest, they spurned
and derided me. They in the
World were thought unworthy
of Life, being destitute through
Need and Hunger. Once
they ate Grass and the Bark
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Job xxx. 4.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
of trees, they were disfigured
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Job xxx. 31.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
by their Calamity and Misery,
and now they are not content
with the Community Life, but
separate themselves without
shame, eating of special Meats.
Their Example in this is hurtful
to the rest, and, moreover,
they aspire to Honour among
the Disciples of Christ, who in
this World were held most
worthy of Contempt. They
who often wanted for Barley-bread
and Water, and were
glad to lie under the Hedges,
were the Sons of the Ignorant
and Mean and Unknown, on a
level with my own Wretchedness.
Now they hate me and
fly far from me, and are not
ashamed to spit in my face.
I have suffered Contumely
and Terrors at their Hands,
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Jer. xx. 10.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
and those who were my
Friends and stood by my side
have insulted me. They grew
ashamed of me, and cast me
off all the more that they knew
they had been enriched by my
Favours, so much so that they
even scorned to hear my
Name.</p>

<p><span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Jer. iii. 22.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In my Sorrow I sorrowed
and said unto them: Return,
ye rebellious Children, and I
will heal your Backslidings.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Luke xii. 15, and Ephes. v. 5.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Take heed and beware of
Avarice, which is the Service
of Idols, for the Avaricious
Man shall not be satisfied with
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Eccl. v. 9.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Silver. Call to Mind your
former Days in which, being
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Heb. x. 32.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
illuminated, you endured a
great Fight of Afflictions.
Do not be of them who draw
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Heb. x. 39.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
back unto Perdition, but of
them that believe to the Saving
of the Soul. He who made
void the Law of Moses died
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Heb. x. 28.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
without Mercy under two or
three Witnesses. How much
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Heb. x. 29.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
more, think you, doth he deserve
sorer Punishment, who
hath trodden under Foot the
Son of God, and hath accounted
the Blood of the Covenant, by
which he was sanctified, an
unclean thing, and hath done
despite to the Spirit of Grace?
Return, then, ye Transgressors,
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Isa. xlvi. 8.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
search your Hearts, for a
Man’s life consisteth not in
the abundance of Things which
he possesseth.</p>

<p><span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Job xix. 21, 22.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But they were angered, and
said: Go to, depart from us,
thou miserable thing. We
desire not the knowledge of
thy Ways. And I answered
and said unto them: Have
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Luke xii. 15.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
pity upon me, have pity upon
me, at least, O ye, my Friends.
Why do you persecute me
without a Cause? Did I not
tell you that your Ways and
mine would not agree? It
repenteth me that I have ever
seen you.</p>

<p><span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Cant. vi. 12.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
And the Word of the Lord
came to me, saying: Return,
return, O Shulamite, return,
return, that we may look upon
thee. These are the Children
of Wrath; they will not hear
thee, because they will not
hear Me. Their Hearts have
become stubborn and unbelieving;
they have departed
and gone away, but they have
not rejected thee without rejecting
Me. For thou hast
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Jer. xiii. 21.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
taught them against thee, and
instructed them against thine
own Head, for if they had
never received thee, they would
never have been made rich.
They pretended to love thee,
so that having received thy
Benefits, they might depart
from thee. Wherefore under
adverse Temptation they have
turned away, and having laid
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Jer. viii. 5.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
hold on Lying, they would not
return. Do not again believe
those that speak thee fair, for
they despise thee and seek thy
Life. Do not offer Prayers
or Hymns for them, for I will
not hear thee: I have cast
them off because they have
despised Me.</p>

<p>HOW THE LADY POVERTY
SHOWED THE BLESSED FRANCIS
THE PERFECT WALK IN
THE RELIGIOUS LIFE.</p>
</div>


<p><span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Prov. iv. 25.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Lo! then, dear Brothers, I
have told you a long
story, so that your eyes may
behold where you go, and
that you may see what you
should do. It is perilous to
look back and attempt to
deceive God. Remember
Lot’s wife, and do not believe
every Spirit. But I have
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Luke xvii. 32, and 1 John iv. 1.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
confidence in you, dearest
Brothers, for I see better
Things in you than in any
others, and you are nearer to
Salvation. You seem to have
abandoned Everything, and to
have freed yourselves from all
Burdens. And the best proof
is this, that you have ascended
this Mountain, which it is
given to so few to do. But
I tell you, dear Friends, that
the Wickedness of many
others hath made me suspicious
of the Virtues of the
Good, for I have too oft had
experience of ravening Wolves
in Sheeps’ Clothing.</p>

<p>I desire that each one of
you should become a Follower
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Heb. vi. 12.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
of the Saints, who by Faith
and Patience have come into
my Inheritance. But because
I dread lest the Fate of others
should overtake you, I give
you this salutary Counsel:
that you should not in the
Beginning aim at the Higher
and more Hidden Things, but
that, setting Christ before
you, you should little by little
come to the Highest. Take
heed lest, when the dung of
Poverty has been laid about
your Roots, you should after
all be found barren, for then
there will remain nothing but
the Axe. Do not trust entirely
to the Love which you
now have, for Man is more
prone to Evil than to Good,
and the Soul easily returns to
former Habits, even though it
may long have been separated
from them. I know that with
your great Fervour all Things
seem easy to you. But remember
what is written:
Behold they that serve Him
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Job iv. 18.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
are not steadfast, and in His
Angels He found Wickedness.
At first it will seem sweet to
you to bear Anything, but
after awhile, lulled in Security,
you will become careless of the
Blessings you have received.
You will imagine that you can
return to Him whenever you
wish, and find the old consolation.
But the Spirit of Negligence,
once admitted, is not
so easily got rid of. Your
Heart will turn after other
Things, but Reason will call
you to return to the Former
Things. Lapsed into Sloth
and Idleness, Words of Excuse
will rise easily to your Lips:
We cannot be strong as we
were in the Beginning, and
now the Times are changed;
not knowing that it is written:
When a Man hath come to
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Eccli. xvii. 6.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
his End then would he make a
Beginning. For a voice will
always dwell in your Hearts,
saying: To-morrow, and To-morrow,
we will return to the
former Man, for it was better
with us then than it is now.
Behold, I have foretold you
many Things, my Brothers,
and many other things have I
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>John xvi. 12.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
to say unto you, which ye
cannot bear now. But the
Hour cometh when I shall
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>John xvi. 25.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
speak to you plainly of All
Things.</p>

<p>OF THE SOJOURN OF MY LADY
POVERTY WITH THE BROTHERS</p>
</div>


<p>And when the Brothers
had made all Things
ready, they urged the Lady
Poverty to eat with them.
But she said unto them: Show
me first your Oratory, the
Cloister and Chapter House,
the Refectory, Kitchen, Dormitory,
and Stables, your fine
Seats and polished Tables and
noble Houses. For I see
none of these Things, and yet
I do see that you are blithe
and cheerful, abounding in
Joy, filled with Consolation, as
if you expected all these
Things to be supplied to you
at will. But they made answer
and said: O Lady and Queen,
we thy Servants are weary
with the long Journey, and
thou in coming with us hast
endured not a little. Therefore,
if it please thee, let us
eat first, and thus refreshed,
we will do thy Bidding. And
my Lady answered: It pleaseth
me well. But first bring
Water that we may wash our
Hands, and a Cloth wherewith
to dry them. And they
brought forth a broken earthenware
Vessel&mdash;for they had
no sound one&mdash;full of Water.
And having poured the Water
on her hands they searched
on all sides for a Cloth. But
when none could be found,
one of the Brethren offered
the Habit he wore, that therewith
my Lady might wipe her
Hands. And giving Thanks
she took it, magnifying God
with all her Heart Who had
given her such Men as Companions.</p>

<p>And after this they led her
to the Place where the Table
was made ready. But she
looked round about, and seeing
Nothing save three or four
Crusts of Barley-bread laid
upon the Grass, she marvelled
exceedingly within herself,
saying: Who ever saw the
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Wisdom xii. 13, 18, 19.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Like in the Generations of
Old? Blessed art Thou, O
Lord God, Who hast care of
All, for Thy Power is at hand
when Thou wilt, and Thou
hast taught Thy People, that
by such Works they may
please Thee. And thus they
sat a while giving Thanks to
God for all His Gifts. Then
my Lady Poverty commanded
them to bring in Dishes the
Food which they had cooked.
But they fetched a Basin full
of cold Water, that all might
dip their Bread therein, for
here was there no abundance
of Dishes or superfluity of
Cooks. My Lady Poverty
then begged that she might
at least have some uncooked
savoury Herbs, but having
neither Garden nor Gardener,
the Brethren gathered some
wild Herbs in the Wood, and
placed them before her. Who
said: Bring me a little Salt,
that I may savour these Herbs,
for they are bitter. But they
answered her: Then must thou
tarry a while, Lady, until we
go into the City to obtain it,
if haply there should be any
one who would give us some.
Then she asked them, saying:
Fetch hither a Knife that I
may trim these Herbs, and cut
the Bread, which verily is hard
and dry. Who answered: O
Lady, we have no Smith to
make us knives. For the
present, use thy Teeth in the
place of a Knife, and afterwards
we will provide. Whereupon
she said: Have you a
little Wine? To which they
answered: No, Lady, we have
no Wine, for the necessaries of
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Eccli. xxix. 28.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Man’s Life are Bread and
Water, and it is not good for
thee to drink Wine, for the
Spouse of Christ should shun
Wine as Poison.</p>

<p>And when they were satisfied,
rejoicing more in the
Nobility of Want than if they
had had an Abundance of All
Things, they blessed the Lord,
in Whose Sight they had
found such Favour, and led
my Lady Poverty to a Place
where she might sleep, for she
was weary. And she lay down
upon the bare ground. And
when she asked for a Pillow,
they straightway brought her
a Stone, and laid it under her
Head. So after she had slept
for a brief space in Peace, she
arose and asked the Brothers
to show her their Cloister.
And they, leading her to the
Summit of a Hill, showed her
the wide World, saying: This
is our Cloister, O Lady
Poverty. Thereupon she bade
them all sit down together,
and opening her Mouth she
began to speak unto them
Words of Life, saying:</p>

in those Things which you
have begun by the Inspiration
of the Holy Ghost, not abandoning
your Perfection as is
the Custom with some, but
avoiding all the Snares of
Darkness, strive ever after
Things more Perfect. Most
high is your Perfection, above

and it excels in its Brightness
the Perfection of your Forefathers.

dance before the Lord,
knowing that their Victory in
the Face of the Enemy is often

<p>THE SPIRITUAL SIGNIFICANCE
OF EVANGELICAL
POVERTY</p>
</div>


<p>“This is the sublimity of
most high Poverty
which has made you, beloved
brethren, heirs and kings of
the Kingdom of Heaven.”<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
Thus wrote St Francis of
Assisi when he gave his disciples
the Rule which obliged
them to “serve the Lord in
poverty and humility.” It is
easy to recognise in these
words the note of exultation
and achievement which made
St Francis the most inspiring
personality in Mediæval
Christendom, and which gives
to his name, even to-day, a singular
power over the imagination
of the Christian World.
Clad in his peasant’s dress,
and with no possessions of his
own in the world save his soul
and body,<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> he is nevertheless
the man rich in all things that
are of vital interest, the clear
spiritual vision, the perfect joy,
the encompassing sympathy,
which gathers all palpitating
life into its own. Francis
<i>lived</i>, if ever a man lived. His
was the liberty of soul which
finds the joy of life in all Creation.</p>

<p>Artificial stimulus and transient
excitement could add
nought to the Joy that was
his. To him the sky and the
earth, the sun and the flowers,
the fields and all living things,
spoke with articulate speech of
the life that is in them.
As for his fellow-men, their
life was his life. He had come
to pass beyond the bounds of
his own personality, and to
enter into that spiritual communion
with all living things,
whereby man escapes from his
own limitations, and the world
lives in him as he in the world.
And above all, and yet in all,
he beheld the ever blessed
God, the Author of all life
that is. To Francis, God was
ever present in the Creation,
the Life behind all life. “The
Heavens show forth the Glory
of God, and the Firmament
declareth the Work of His
Hands.” The intimate relationship
binding creation to its
Creator was to him an abiding
perception; he could not think
of Earth apart from Heaven,
nor of finite man apart from
the Infinite God. Whatever
was good and beautiful was to
him an indication of the Divine
Goodness and Beauty, a portal
of the Eternal Kingdom; and
with keen spiritual intuition he
discovered the good and the
beautiful, where men of lesser
sensibility would only find the
commonplace and the material.
“To them that love God, all
things work together unto
Good;”<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> the truly spiritual
man discovers the imprint of
the Divine Life along all the
highways and byways of
Creation: just as the poet’s
eye discovers beauty in the
woodland through which the
ordinary wayfarer passes unheeding.</p>

<p>Thus the whole creation
poured into the Soul of Francis
an unceasing stream of spiritual
life, and with the inflowing
life came joy&mdash;joy unutterable;
and sorrow too. For life as it
is, has no joy altogether separate
from pain. There is tragedy
in the purest romance, death
even where there is life. And
so the “joyous troubadour of
God” sorrowed much because
of the shadow that lay across
the sunshine. To him personally
life was joy, such was
his liberty of spirit; but it was
not so to all men. Many are
they to whom life is sorrow;
they walk as in a dark valley
with but the twilight around
them; nay, at times with no
light at all, but only darkness,
and their souls are starved for
lack of light and warmth; even
when in their ignorance or
despair they seek pleasure in
the immediate objects of sense
around them. For these he
sorrowed with the sorrow of
Christ weeping over Jerusalem.
It was a sorrow which kept him
at long vigils when the world
lay asleep, praying for mercy
for the souls of men. Yet this
sorrow could not destroy the
essential joy of life which was
his in a super-eminent degree.
He sorrowed as many a man
and woman sorrows over a
friend who is deprived of the
happiness which is their own.</p>

<p>Truly was Francis a “King
and heir of the Kingdom,” if
Kingship means sovereign possession;
for he found what is
best in life and had it as his
own, nought else than the very
joy of life. Francis himself
has told us how this joy of
life came to him with the absolute
renunciation of what
the world at large holds most
dear&mdash;wealth, place, and
power. In renunciation he
found spiritual freedom, and
with it joy. No man is truly
joyous whose joy does not
spring from his own soul, or
from that inalienable possession
of the world which comes
of spiritual communion with
what is good and true in it,
and therefore Eternal.</p>

<p>The joy which is dependent
upon the possession of the
merely visible and material
can never reach the inmost
spirit of man, even were such
possession not, at best, uncertain
and of its nature
transitory. Nay, the joy of
life, which springs from man’s
own spirit, is impossible to him
whose heart is set upon the
merely external world. For
the spiritual and the material
are in the immediate aspect a
simple antithesis; so that where
the one is, the other cannot be.
“You cannot serve God and
mammon.” You cannot satisfy
your nature with the transitory,
and yet retain an appetite for
the Eternal. Consequently, he
who would be free and retain
a relish for the life of the
Spirit, must beware of the lust
of the earth, and keep a detached
heart towards what is
of its nature unspiritual.</p>

<p>To St Francis, a man
amongst men, the lust of the
earth was radically allied with
pride of class, an inordinate
ambitiousness of glory, and a
love of luxury. Poverty, as
Francis understood it, meant
the antithesis of all this. The
Lady Poverty (to borrow the
Saint’s own imagery) was an
outcast; she was the despised
of men; and she walked amid
the rough ways of the earth
with threadbare garments and
bruised feet.</p>

<p>The story how Francis found
his ideal bride and came to
love her with chivalric devotion,
is too well known to need
repetition. The final act in
the drama came when one day,
riding in the plain before
Assisi, he was met by a leper
who besought an alms, and,
filled with disgust, he at first
thought to pass on, but, moved
by a nobler impulse, cast himself
from his horse, and not
only gave the alms, but folded
the leper to his breast and
embraced him. From that
moment he himself has told
us that “what had seemed
bitter was changed into sweetness
of soul and body, and not
long afterwards I left the
world.”<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>The embrace of the leper
marked the final abandonment
in Francis’ soul of the sense
of separation between himself,
the son of the wealthy Bernardone,
and the outcasts of
society. Henceforth to Francis,
the poor and the outcast were
human brethren, worthy of a
brother’s intimate love and
care. In the same moment he
cast aside, once for all, his
youthful dream of entering
the ranks of chivalry, and
seeking renown in battle and
tournament. Henceforth he
would be the servant of his
brothers the poor, and “serve
the Lord in Poverty and
Humility.”</p>

<p>The path of renunciation
was further determined for
him when his new ideal of
life clashed with the commercial
interests of his family.
In the newly-awakened consciousness
of his kinship with
the poor, he considered his
share in the family business as
their share, and freely parted
with what he had a right to
consider his own. Pietro
Bernardone, his father, foresaw
commercial ruin from such a
course, and when he found
that Francis was indissolubly
wedded to his ideal, promptly
disinherited him. Henceforth
Francis was without house or
property of his own. With
the keenness of a soul set free,
he at once recognised in his
father’s act of disinheritance
the charter of his spiritual
freedom. “Now in truth can
I say: Our Father Who art
in Heaven!” Heaven and
earth became his when in
the moment of abandonment
he called God his Father.
Thus he cast from himself
forever the three dominant
tyrannies which in his own age
and since, have oppressed the
souls of men&mdash;wealth, place,
and power. He had become
in very truth the Poor Man of
Assisi, and yet who was
richer than he?</p>

<p>Never did Francis regret his
renunciation, but ever did the
thought of it fill him with
gratitude and joy. One day,
some years after his disinheritance,
the Saint and one of his
disciples, Brother Masseo,
were eating a scanty meal of
broken bread, begged by the
way; they ate near a fountain,
and a large stone was their
table. “O Brother Masseo,”
said Francis, his soul bubbling
with joy, “we are not worthy
of so great a treasure;” and he
repeated these words several
times. Brother Masseo answered:
“Father, how canst
thou talk of a treasure where
there is so much poverty
and indeed a lack of all
things? for we have neither
cloth, nor knife nor dish,
nor table, nor house; neither
have we servant nor maid
to wait upon us.” Then
said the Saint: “And this is
the very reason why I look
upon it as a great treasure,
because man has no hand in it,
but all has been given us by
Divine Providence, as we
clearly see in this bread of
charity, in this beautiful table
of stone, and in this clear
fountain.”<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Surely here we
find the very apotheosis of
poverty; of the poverty which,
discarding the artificial, is
happy in the simple realities
and in the bounties of nature,
and feels no barrier between
itself and the spiritual
possession of the very earth
itself.</p>

<p>Here it may be as well to
take note how alien is the
poverty of Francis from the
vulgarity and squalor, the
idleness and discontent, which
mark too frequently the life
of the poor. No greater misconception
of Franciscan
poverty could there be than
to conceive it as sanctioning
or condoning any condition
that detracts from the proper
native dignity of man. The
“Lady Poverty” of Francis
went with bare and bruised
feet, her garment was coarse,
and she ate but the bread of
the peasant; but she retained
her native dignity of soul,
and bore herself as a Queen
wherever she went. She
delighted in the pure air,
and the flowers, and the
running stream, was honest
and self-revering, simple and
joyous.</p>

<p>The poverty of our city
slums where hearts break in
discontent, and souls are
starved for lack of spiritual
intelligence&mdash;such was not the
poverty of Francis’ dream.
To use again his own manner
of speech, this is poverty in
slavery, degraded and dishonoured
by the vice and
selfishness of man. With a
full heart would he have set
himself to rescue his Ideal
from her modern degradation
and restore her to her place
of honour upon the earth.
Knight-errant as he was, he
would not have rested until
poverty was made honourable
amongst men. To rescue the
poor from the conditions which
have so effectually demoralised
them during the past two or
three centuries of unheeding
individualism, would undoubtedly
have been to Francis
a first and urgent duty were
he with us to-day. Even in
his own time he regarded with
anxiety the conditions which
debased the poor; even then
he considered himself the
knight-errant sent to rescue
the comely maiden Poverty
from the neglect and heartless
scorn of the world.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> But was
ever Italian peasant so utterly
degraded as are many of the
victims of modern industrialism?
Poverty with Francis
was the mother of spiritual
freedom; poverty in the
London slum is synonymous
with hard materialism and
irreligion. Was ever contrast
greater? And yet Francis
has made evident to us that
beneath the squalor and degradation
of the modern city,
there is a spiritual possibility,
if only it can be recovered.
But will it ever be that poverty
shall again regain amongst the
hungry multitude the honourable
estate with which the
Saint of Assisi had endowed
it? Will it ever be rescued
from its present inhuman conditions?
The future only can
tell; and they who strive that
it shall be so can only work
in the strength of their faith;
but faith verily can accomplish
the apparently impossible, if
faith itself be strong. Meanwhile
the ideal of Francis has
assuredly a prophetic message
for the multitude which is not
hungry.</p>

<p>Poverty, as Francis preached
it, is an integral element in the
Christian life. Christianity
imperatively demands of all
its followers an acceptance of
the truth which Francis embodied
so wonderfully in himself.
No one can enter the
Kingdom of Heaven unless he
be as Francis was, a lover of
Poverty. Such is the Gospel.
“Blessed are the poor in spirit,
for theirs is the Kingdom of
Heaven.”<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> There are those
who so interpret this beatitude
as to empty it of all significance
concerning material
possessions. The meaning of
Christ, however, is made clear,
by His own earthly life and by
the lives of His early disciples.
“Poverty of Spirit” means
nothing less than detachment
of heart from the possession or
achievement of material gain,
and from its attendant
pleasures. No man can be a
disciple of Christ who is not
free from the moral slavery
which wealth and temporal
possessions so easily set upon
the soul. To no man is given
the spiritual insight and vision
which alone can bring rest
eternal to man’s spirit, unless
he have first put from him
the lust of the earth. And
according to the measure
of his detachment is spiritual
achievement possible.</p>

<p>Is then every man to imitate
St Francis of Assisi,
and cast off all wealth and
become dependent upon the
labour of his hands or the
charity of his neighbour? No
such claim is made by Francis,
for it was not made by Christ.
If Christ demanded of the
young man that he should “go
and sell what he had and give
it to the poor” in order to
follow Him, He also acquiesced
in the rich Zacchæus
keeping his wealth so long as
he did not neglect his duty to
those in need. Francis, too,
following the Divine Model,
gave no injunction to the
Lord of Chiusi or to the Lady
Giacoma to renounce their
property, and he expressly
forbade his friars, who like
himself gave up all right of
possession, to judge those who
have possessions. No, it is not
the holding of property, but
the selfish misuse of it and the
inordinate desire of material
gain and its pleasures, which
is opposed to the virtue of
evangelical poverty. In few
words may the Christian precept
of poverty be set forth:
Let no man set his heart on
any material possession for its
own sake, or for the mere
holding of it; if a man is lacking
in this world’s goods, let
him not fret nor complain,
but seek rather the life of the
spirit. If, on the other hand,
he is endowed with this world’s
goods, either by inheritance or
as the result of honest labour,
let him bear in mind that such
goods are not absolutely his
own; they belong, in the first
instance, to God, the Master of
all, and may rightfully be used
and distributed only subject to
the Divine laws of justice and
charity. No man has an
absolute ownership before
God, so that he may satisfy
his own whim or pleasure
without consideration for what
is due by Divine Law to his
fellow-men. Possession in the
sphere of conscience is stewardship.
The rich are God’s
stewards, appointed to “give
to every man his just measure
in due season.” Such briefly
is the precept of Evangelical
Poverty&mdash;a precept which has
no direct connection with any
theory of social economics, but
is based upon the fundamental
law of religion, that only the
poor in spirit are spiritually
free and capable of citizenship
in the realm of eternal life.</p>

<p>Assuredly to us who live our
lives upon the pulse of a great
industrial empire, this message
of the Poverello comes with a
distinctness not to be passed
unheeded. As a race we are
a prosperous people, and
money-making is our first
preoccupation. Luxuries are
easily within our grasp; cheap
luxuries, perhaps, which is all
the worse, for that very cheapness
is a snare blinding us to
the fact that what we indulge
in is a luxury. In money-making
and luxury lie the
elemental dangers to our
spiritual life. “Money,” says
Cardinal Newman, “is a sort
of creation, and gives the
acquirer, even more than the
possessor, an imagination of
his own power, and tends to
make him idolise himself.
Again, what we have hardly
won we are unwilling to part
with; so that a man who has
himself made his wealth will
commonly be penurious, or, at
least, will not part with it except
in exchange for what will
reflect credit on himself or increase
his importance. Even
when his conduct is most disinterested
and amiable (as in
spending for the comfort of
those who depend on him),
still this indulgence of self,
of pride, and worldliness insinuates
itself.” And he adds:
“If such be the effect of the
pursuit of gain on an individual,
doubtless it will be
the same on a nation; and if
the peril be so great in the one
case, why should it be less in
the other?”<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> The enduring
strength of a nation, as of an
individual, depends upon moral
fibre and spiritual vision. If
these be destroyed no nation
can long remain save as a warning
to the nations that shall
come. Undoubtedly there are
strong tendencies amongst us
towards the worship of wealth
and its attendant luxuries and
towards a selfish accumulation
of wealth beyond all possible
needs, tendencies which acquire
strength with the growth of
empire and trade. Well for
us is it that at this time
Francis of Assisi is becoming
widely known. To all who
revolt against the vulgar
materialism which dominates
so much of our present life,
Francis of Assisi is as a
prophet sent by God. Standing
against the dark background
of Avarice and Luxury
which had already infested the
growing commercial centres of
the mediæval world, he throws
the light of his own clear personality
into the dark corners
of our own life.</p>

<p>We yearn, many of us, for
a deeper spiritual life; we
sorrow because the joy of
life seems flitting ever further
and further away from this
complex social organism of
ours. We seek direction, and
the Poverello is here to lead us;
and the way he leads is that
of detachment and renunciation.
But his own personality
and life are an assurance to us
that the renunciation he
preaches, leads to richer gain;
he leads us through death,
only that we may find life
even here, in some measure,
upon the earth, and in the
fulness of the spirit hereafter.
Thus and not otherwise does
he interpret to us the Poverty
of Christ.</p>

<p>A PRAYER OF THE BLESSED
FRANCIS TO OBTAIN HOLY
POVERTY.</p>
</div>


<p>O Lord Jesus! Show
me the ways of Thy
dearly-loved Poverty. I know
that the Old Testament was but
a Figure of the New. In the
Old, Thou hast promised that
“every place that your foot
shall tread upon, shall be
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Deut. xi. 24.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
yours.” To tread under foot
is to despise; Poverty treads
all Things under foot, therefore
she is the Queen of all
Things. But, O my dear
Lord Jesus, have pity upon me
and upon my Lady Poverty,
for I am consumed with Love
for her, and can know no rest
without her. Thou knowest
all this, my Lord, Thou who
didst fill me with the Love of
her. But she sitteth in sadness,
rejected of all; she, the Mistress
of Nations, is become as a
Widow; the Queen of all
Virtues is become contemptible; <span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Lament. i. 1.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
and sitting upon a dunghill
she lamenteth that all her
friends have despised her and
have become her enemies; for
long now she knows them to
be wantons and no Spouses of
hers.</p>

<p>Remember, O Lord Jesus,
that Poverty is so much the
Queen of the Virtues, that
Thou, forsaking the dwelling-place
of the Angels, didst
descend upon Earth in order
to espouse her in Love Everlasting,
and so as to bring forth
in her, and by her, and through
her, all the Children of Perfection.
And she clung to Thee
with such Fidelity, that even
within Thy Mother’s womb
she paid Thee homage, for Thy
Infant Body was, it is thought,
the smallest of all. And at
Thy Birth she received Thee
in a Holy Manger and Stable;
and in Thy Life upon Earth
she so deprived Thee of all
things, that Thou hadst no
place where to lay Thy Head.
And as a faithful Helpmeet
she followed Thee loyally when
Thou didst go forth to do
battle for our Redemption,
and in the Agony of the
Passion she was Thy only
Armour-bearer. When Thy
Disciples denied Thee and fled,
she alone did not leave Thee,
but was Thy faithful Companion
with all the host of
her Princes.</p>

<p>Even Thy own Mother (who
alone did faithfully honour
Thee, and with grievous
Sorrow share Thy Passion),
even she, I say, could not by
reason of the height of the
Cross, reach up unto Thee,
but the Lady Poverty in all
her Penury, like a most dear
Servitor, did there hold Thee
in an ever closer embrace, and
join herself more and more
nearly to Thy Sufferings. For
the which reason she did not
wait to smooth Thy Cross, nor
to give It even the rudest
preparation; nor, it is thought,
did she even make sufficient
Nails for Thy Wounds, nor
sharpen or polish them, but
furnished three only, all rough
and jagged and blunted, to
support Thee in Thy Martyrdom.
And when Thou wast
dying of a burning Thirst, Thy
faithful Spouse was careful
lest Thou shouldst have one
drop of Water even, and by
the hands of the impious
Soldiery, prepared Thee a Cup
of such bitterness, that Thou
couldst only taste, but not
drink of it. And in the close
Embrace of this Thy Spouse,
Thou didst yield up the Ghost.</p>

<p>But so faithful a Spouse was
not absent at Thy Burial and
would not suffer Thee to have
anything of Thy own, either
Sepulchre or Ointments or
Linen, for these were all
borrowed from others. Nor
did she fail to be present at
Thy Resurrection; for rising
gloriously in her Embrace,
Thou didst leave behind in the
Sepulchre all those things
which had been borrowed.
And then Thou didst take
her up into Heaven with Thee,
abandoning all earthly things
to those that are of the Earth,
and bequeathing unto the
Lady Poverty the Seal of the
Kingdom of Heaven, wherewith
she might seal the Elect
who desire to walk in the Way
of Perfection.</p>

<p>O who would not love the
Lady Poverty above all things!
Of Thee, O Jesus, I ask to be
signed with this Privilege; I
long to be enriched with this
Treasure; I beseech Thee, O
most poor Jesus, that, for Thy
sake, it may be the Mark of
me and mine to all Eternity,
to possess no thing of our own
under the Sun, but to live in
penury upon the goods of
others, so long as this vile
body lasts.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p class="center">NOTE</p>
</div>

<p>This remarkable prayer figures
as the composition of St
Francis in all the editions of
his works from Wadding
(Antwerp, 1623) to Fra
Bernardo da Fivizzano
(Florence, 1880). But we
have (unfortunately) no satisfactory
or scientific proof that
the prayer was really the
composition of the Seraphic
Patriarch. Wadding took it
from Ubertino da Casale
“Arbor Vitæ Crucifixi Jesu”
(Venice, 1485). Ubertino
wrote his redoubtable book in
1305, and though he puts this
prayer into the mouth of St
Francis, the context points to
the fact that he is rather attempting
to reproduce the
sentiments of the Saint, than
giving a prayer literally written
by him. And his indebtedness
to the “Sacrum Commercium”
is obvious. But whether written
by St Francis or not, there
can be no doubt that when he
prayed, he often prayed after
this fashion. It most faithfully
reflects his spirit and
ideas, and is admirably illustrative
of the “Sacrum Commercium.”
For this reason we
have given it a place in the
Appendix. It is also interesting
as being the probable
source whence Dante drew
his beautiful idea that the
Lady Poverty was more privileged
than the Blessed Virgin,
insomuch as she followed the
Lord up on to the very Cross
itself:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<i>Si che, dove Maria rimase giuso,</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Ella con Cristo salse<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> in su la croce.</i>”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The naïve sublimity of the
concluding petition of the
prayer “et alienis rebus semper
cum usus penuria, dum vivit
caro misera, sustentari,” is most
characteristic of the Saint, not
only in its sentiment but in
its Franciscan directness. It
strikes strangely upon modern
ears to hear a Divine petition
that certain men may ever
be known as men who lived
upon others. But it is logical,
as Francis always was. There
can be no evangelical poverty
with possessions, and yet man
must keep body and soul together;
hence mendicancy is
the only resource of the real
lovers of my Lady Poverty.
This sentiment recalls the
famous saying of St Francis
in the Fifth of his “Collationes
Monasticæ”: “There is a compact
between the World and
my Brothers. They owe it a
good example, and the World
in return must provide them
with all necessities. But if the
Brothers, breaking faith, cease
to give their good example,
the World will, with justice,
withdraw its helping hand.”</p>

<p>Very interesting, and of considerable
importance, is the
fact that this Prayer speaks of
Christ being crucified with
three nails only. Whether
St Francis wrote the prayer or
not, we may take this to have
been his opinion, for it seems
to have been the common
opinion of the thirteenth century.
And bearing in mind
this opinion of his, it becomes
impossible to attribute the
phenomena of his Stigmata to
subjective causes, or to that
which is loosely called hysteria.
The Stigmata of St Francis
were not merely open wounds,
but showed nails of a black
fleshy substance, one in each
hand and one in each foot. If
these Stigmata had been the
result of intense meditation on
the Passion, then, seeing what
his opinion was, the singular
phenomena which were developed
in him, would have
shown one nail only for the
feet, and not a nail in either
foot. The point is of capital
importance to investigators of
a remarkable occurrence which,
while proved beyond a doubt
as a matter of fact, has hitherto
found no scientific explanation.</p>

Psalm xxiii. 10, “Dominus Virtutum,” he
is, from the context which follows,
obviously not referring to the Lord of

one of the Orders of Angels, but to God
as the Lord of the Moral Perfections.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_22" href="#FNanchor_22" class="label">[22]</a> So that Man’s first transgression

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_25" href="#FNanchor_25" class="label">[25]</a> In this terrible picture of Religious
life at its lowest ebb, some allowance
must be made for the fervid imagination
and righteous wrath of the holy writer
(“<i>quidam sanctus doctor hujus sanctae Paupertatis
professor et zelator strenuus</i>”). But even
with sloth, gluttony, intemperance, greed
of gain, hypocrisy, and ungodliness
running riot in a whole Community, it
is profitable to the historian to note that
there is not a hint of unchastity, the
truth being that a Community wholly
unchaste is one of those rarities of history
sought in the past, and desired, I fear, by
certain historians, but scarcely existing
outside the cruel inventions of interested
despoilers. And lest any be amazed that
the Religious life should ever have fallen
even half as low as is here portrayed, let
them remember that the higher the ideal,
the further the fall when it comes, and
that the Lady Poverty has ever punished
her betrayers by the completest degradation.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_26" href="#FNanchor_26" class="label">[26]</a> “Terribilis ut castrorum acies ordinata.”
This occurs in the Chapter at
Prime in the Office of Our Lady, and
hence it is here used in connection with
that other Lady, Madonna Povertà. The
translator of the “Meditazione,” finding
it would have no associations in Italian
(as of course it has none in English),
quietly drops it, but I cannot take so
great a liberty, nor allow myself to hide
the vivid and touching imagination
which the pious author thus betrays.
Throughout the whole allegory the
influence of the Liturgy is conspicuous.</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
